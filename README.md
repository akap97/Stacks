# Stacks
 ## problems based on stack

#### 1) postfixeval: Given a postfix expression, the task is to evaluate the expression and print the final value. Operators will only include the basic arithmetic operators like *,/,+ and - . 

#### 2) StackWithMax:  Implement a stack supporting the operations Push(), Pop(), and Max().

#### 3) MatchingBrackets: Input contains one string S which consists of big and small latin letters, digits, punctuation marks and brackets from the set []{}(). If the code in S uses brackets correctly, output “Success" (without the quotes). Otherwise, output the 1-based index of the first unmatched closing bracket, and if there are no unmatched closing brackets, output the 1-based index of the first unmatched opening bracket.

### 4) minO(1): Design a data-structure SpecialStack that supports all the stack operations like push(), pop(), isEmpty(), isFull() and an additional operation getMin() which should return minimum element from the SpecialStack. Your task is to complete all the functions, using stack data-Structure.
